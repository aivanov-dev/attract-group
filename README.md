## Api Routes

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- /api/register;
- /api/login;
- /api/logout;
- /api/users/me;
- /api/users/except-me;
- /messages/send/users/{id}   //all messages sent by me to user with id:{id};
- /api/messages/received/users/{id}  //all messages received by me from user with id:{id}.
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).
